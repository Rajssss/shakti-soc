This is a standalone C-Program which has basic routines to read/write into a Microchip BFM through I2C controller. 
References have been taken from i2c-algo-pcf.c which can be found in linux kernel sources under the subdirectory path-to-linux-dir/drivers/i2c/algos/ 
The software basically polls the configuration registers to see what has happened and does the next course of steps. This code does 32 byte write to the EEPROM and reads the same and checks if written value is correctly read to ensure functional correctness. 
TODO : Check with interrupts.
